# Project-Bayesian-Macroeconomics
Matlab/Dynare implementation of a Two-Agent DSGE model. Features steady-state derivation, stationarity transformation, SMM minimization for calibration, and Bayesian estimation using the Kalman Filter.
This project is based on the Exam_BayesianMacro.pdf assignment.

The full report detailing our methodology, results, and interpretations can be found in Report.pdf.
